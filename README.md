# AC_GAM1546_FinalProject
Final project for GAM1546: Game and Graphics Computations II. Starting with a basic C++/OpenGL framework, we had to create a 2D game. I decided to create a top down space shooter game. In it you control a space ship, you can move around, shoot, activate a shield, and shoot down enemy ships.
